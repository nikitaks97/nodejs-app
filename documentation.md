    â””â”€â”€ index.test.js         # Automated tests
```

**Goal:**
- Serve a static website using Node.js.
- Containerize the app for portability.
- Deploy to Kubernetes (k3s, Docker Desktop, or cloud).
- Automate testing and deployment with CI/CD.

---

## 2. Application Source Code (`index.js`)

- **Purpose:** Implements a basic HTTP server using Node.js core modules (`http`, `fs`, `path`).
- **How it works:**
  - Listens on port `3002` (changeable in the code).
  - Serves `public/index.html` for `/` and `/index.html` requests.
  - Serves static assets (CSS, JS, images) from `public/assets/`.
  - Returns a 404 error for unknown routes.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Uses `fs.readFile` to read files asynchronously.
  - Detects content type based on file extension for correct browser rendering.
  - Modular and easily extensible for more routes or features.

---

## 3. Static Files (`public/`)

- **index.html:** The homepage. You can edit this file to change the main content of your website.
- **assets/:** Contains static resources:
  - `style.css`: Stylesheet for your site.
  - `main.js`: Client-side JavaScript.
  - Images (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`).

---

## 4. Project Configuration (`package.json`)

- **Purpose:** Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.
- **Key Sections:**
  - `name`, `version`, `description`: Project info.
  - `scripts`: Shortcuts for common tasks:
    - `start`: Runs the server (`node index.js`).
    - `build`: Outputs a message (no build step needed for static site).
    - `test`: Runs Mocha tests.
  - `devDependencies`: Lists `mocha` for testing.
- **How to use:**
  - Install dependencies: `npm install`
  - Start app: `npm start`
  - Run tests: `npm test`
  - Build (no-op): `npm run build`

---

## 5. Automated Testing (`test/index.test.js`)

- **Framework:** Mocha (installed as a dev dependency).
- **Purpose:** Ensures the server responds as expected.
- **Test Cases:**
  - Homepage returns expected HTML (checks for `<title>` tag).
  - Unknown page returns 404 and 'Page Not Found'.
- **How to run:**
  ```sh
  npm install      # Installs dependencies (including Mocha)
  npm test         # Runs all tests in test/
  ```
- **How it works:**
  - Starts the server on a test port.
  - Makes HTTP requests to the server and checks responses.
  - Shuts down the server after tests.

---

## 6. Dockerization (`Dockerfile`)

- **Purpose:** Packages the app and its dependencies into a portable container image.
- **Key Instructions:**
  - `FROM node:20-alpine`: Uses a lightweight Node.js image.
  - `WORKDIR /app`: Sets working directory.
  - `COPY ...`: Copies code and static files.
  - `RUN npm install --production`: Installs only production dependencies.
  - `EXPOSE 3002`: Exposes port 3002 for the app.
  - `CMD ["node", "index.js"]`: Starts the server.
- **How to build and run locally:**
  ```sh
  docker build -t nodejs-app:latest .
  docker run -p 3002:3002 nodejs-app:latest
  ```
  - `docker build ...` creates the image.
  - `docker run ...` starts the container and maps port 3002.

---

## 7. Testing and Code Coverage Setup

### Testing Framework (Mocha)
- **Purpose:** Provides structure and runtime for automated tests
- **Key Features:**
  - Asynchronous testing support
  - Test suite organization with `describe` blocks
  - Individual test cases with `it` blocks
  - Setup and teardown hooks (`before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`)
  - Works with Node's built-in `assert` module

### Code Coverage Tool (C8)
- **Purpose:** Measures how much of your code is executed during tests
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses V8's built-in coverage capabilities
  - Generates detailed reports in multiple formats:
    - lcov for SonarQube/SonarCloud integration
    - HTML for human-readable reports
    - Text for terminal output
  - Tracks multiple coverage metrics:
    - Statements (executed code statements)
    - Branches (if/else and switch/case decisions)
    - Functions (function calls)
    - Lines (code lines executed)

### Coverage Report Structure
```
coverage/
â”œâ”€â”€ lcov.info                # Machine-readable coverage data
â””â”€â”€ lcov-report/            # Human-readable HTML reports
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Coverage summary
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.js.html       # Detailed per-file coverage
    â””â”€â”€ ...other assets
```

### NPM Scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha",
    "test:coverage": "c8 --reporter=lcov --reporter=text mocha"
  }
}
```

### SonarCloud Integration
- **Configuration:** (`sonar-project.properties`)
```properties
sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov.info
sonar.coverage.exclusions=test/**/*
```

### Current Coverage Stats
- Statements: 100% (53/53)
- Branches: 100% (19/19)
- Functions: 100% (0/0)
- Lines: 100% (53/53)

### Test Cases Implemented
1. **Server Operations:**
   - Server startup and shutdown
   - Response to homepage request
   - 404 handling for unknown routes

2. **Static Asset Serving:**
   - CSS files with correct MIME type
   - JavaScript files with correct MIME type
   - Image files (PNG, JPG, SVG) with correct MIME types
   - 404 for missing assets

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Server errors (500) when files can't be read
   - Proper cleanup after tests

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Isolated Test Environment:**
  - Uses different port (3002) for testing
  - Creates and cleans up test files
  - Restores modified system state

- **Comprehensive Testing:**
  - Tests both success and error paths
  - Verifies content types and status codes
  - Checks response bodies for expected content

- **Clean Test Structure:**
  - Uses before/after hooks for setup/teardown
  - Groups related tests with describe blocks
  - Clear, descriptive test names

---

## 8. Kubernetes Deployment

- **Deployment (`k8s-deployment.yaml`):**
  - Deploys the Docker image as a pod.
  - Sets `containerPort: 3002` (must match app and Dockerfile).
- **Service (`k8s-service.yaml`):**
  - Exposes the pod using `NodePort`.
  - Maps external port 30080 to internal port 3002.
- **How to deploy:**
  ```sh
  kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml
  kubectl apply -f k8s-service.yaml
  ```
- **How to access:**
  - Docker Desktop: http://localhost:30080/
  - k3s/EC2: http://<EC2-IP>:30080/
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Check pod/service status: `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get services`
  - View logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
  - Port-forward if NodePort is not working: `kubectl port-forward service/nodejs-app-service 30080:3002`

### SonarQube Scan and Quality Gate (CI/CD)

- **SonarQube Scan:**
  - This step runs a static code analysis using SonarCloud (SonarQube cloud) as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
  - It is configured to use your SonarCloud project and organization by passing `sonar.projectKey` and `sonar.organization` as arguments.
  - These values are securely provided as GitHub secrets: `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY` and `SONAR_ORGANIZATION`.
  - The scan uploads code quality, security, and maintainability results to your SonarCloud dashboard.

- **SonarQube Quality Gate:**
  - This step enforces code quality by waiting for the SonarCloud analysis to complete and checking the project's Quality Gate status.
  - If the project does not meet the required quality standards (e.g., too many bugs, vulnerabilities, or code smells), the workflow fails and stops further deployment.
  - This ensures only code that passes your organization's quality standards is deployed.

- **Why these steps are important:**
  - They automate code quality checks and enforce standards as part of your CI/CD process.
  - They help catch issues early, before code is deployed to production.

- **How to configure:**
  - Make sure you have set the following GitHub repository secrets:
    - `SONAR_TOKEN`: Your SonarCloud token.
    - `SONAR_HOST_URL`: Should be `https://sonarcloud.io` for SonarCloud.
    - `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`: Your SonarCloud project key.
    - `SONAR_ORGANIZATION`: Your SonarCloud organization key.
  - Disable "Automatic Analysis" in SonarCloud project settings to avoid conflicts with CI analysis.

- **Where to view results:**
  - The workflow will fail if the quality gate is not passed. Details are available in the GitHub Actions logs and on your SonarCloud dashboard.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If you see errors about missing properties, make sure all required secrets are set and referenced correctly.
  - If you see errors about "Automatic Analysis", disable it in SonarCloud as described above.

### Setting Up SonarQube Cloud (SonarCloud) for Your Project

Follow these steps to set up SonarCloud (the official SonarQube cloud service) and integrate it with your GitHub Actions workflow:

1. **Create a SonarCloud Account**
   - Go to [https://sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io) and sign up using your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Project**
   - After logging in, click on **+** (plus) in the top right and select **Analyze new project**.
   - Choose your GitHub organization or personal account and select the repository you want to analyze.
   - Click **Set Up**.

3. **Generate a SonarCloud Token**
   - In SonarCloud, click your avatar (top right) > **My Account** > **Security**.
   - Under **Tokens**, enter a name (e.g., `github-actions`) and click **Generate**.
   - Copy the generated token. You will not be able to see it again!

4. **Add SonarCloud Secrets to GitHub**
   - Go to your GitHub repository > **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **New repository secret**.
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `SONAR_TOKEN`: Paste the token you generated in SonarCloud.
     - `SONAR_HOST_URL`: Set this to `https://sonarcloud.io`.

5. **Configure Your Workflow**
   - The provided GitHub Actions workflow already includes a SonarQube scan step using these secrets.
   - The scan will run automatically on every push or pull request.

6. **First Analysis**
   - Push a commit or trigger the workflow manually in GitHub Actions.
   - The SonarCloud scan will run and upload results to your SonarCloud dashboard.

7. **View Results**
   - Go to your project dashboard on [https://sonarcloud.io](https://sonarcloud.io) to see code quality, bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells.

#### Troubleshooting
- If the scan fails, check the GitHub Actions logs for error messages.
- Make sure the secrets are named exactly as required (`SONAR_TOKEN`, `SONAR_HOST_URL`).
- Ensure your repository is public or your SonarCloud plan supports private repos.
- For more help, see the [SonarCloud documentation](https://docs.sonarcloud.io/).

### SonarQube Quality Gate

- **Purpose:** Enforces code quality standards by requiring the project to pass SonarQube's quality gate before continuing the CI/CD pipeline.
- **How it works:**
  - After the SonarQube scan step, the workflow runs the `sonarqube-quality-gate-action`.
  - This step waits for the analysis to complete and checks the quality gate status.
  - If the quality gate fails (e.g., due to too many bugs, vulnerabilities, or code smells), the workflow will fail and stop further deployment.
- **How to use:**
  - No extra configuration is needed if you followed the SonarCloud setup steps and have the scan step in your workflow.
  - You can customize your quality gate in the SonarCloud dashboard under your project settings.
- **Example workflow step:**
    ```yaml
    - name: SonarQube Quality Gate
      uses: SonarSource/sonarqube-quality-gate-action@v1.1.0
      with:
        scanMetadataReportFile: .scannerwork/report-task.txt
      env:
        SONAR_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}
        SONAR_HOST_URL: ${{ secrets.SONAR_HOST_URL }}
    ```
- **Where to view results:**
  - The workflow will fail if the quality gate is not passed. Details are available in the GitHub Actions logs and on your SonarCloud dashboard.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - If the step fails, review the quality gate conditions in SonarCloud and address any issues reported in the analysis.
  - Ensure the scan step runs before the quality gate step and that the `scanMetadataReportFile` path is correct.

## 10. Command Reference & Explanations

### Local Development

- `npm install` â€” Installs all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
  - **What it does:**
    - Reads the `package.json` file for a list of required packages (dependencies and devDependencies).
    - Downloads and installs these packages into the `node_modules/` directory.
    - Creates or updates a `package-lock.json` file to lock exact versions.
  - **When to use:**
    - After cloning the repository for the first time.
    - Whenever dependencies are added or updated in `package.json`.
    - If you delete `node_modules/` and need to reinstall packages.
  - **Example output:**
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    added 50 packages, and audited 50 packages in 2s
    found 0 vulnerabilities
    ```
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - If you see errors, check for missing or incompatible Node.js versions, or issues in `package.json`.
    - Delete `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` again if problems persist.

- `npm start` â€” Runs the server locally on port 3002.
  - **What it does:**
    - Executes the `start` script defined in `package.json` (usually `node index.js`).
    - Starts the Node.js server, serving static files from the `public/` directory.
  - **When to use:**
    - To run the app locally for development or testing.
  - **Example output:**
    ```sh
    $ npm start
    Server running at http://localhost:3002/
    ```

- `npm test` â€” Runs Mocha tests in the `test/` directory.
  - **What it does:**
    - Executes the `test` script in `package.json` (usually `mocha`).
    - Runs all test files (e.g., `test/index.test.js`) using the Mocha testing framework.
    - Starts the server on a test port, sends HTTP requests, and checks responses.
    - Reports test results (pass/fail) in the terminal.
  - **When to use:**
    - After making code changes to verify nothing is broken.
    - Before committing or deploying code.
    - In CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality.
  - **Example output:**
    ```sh
    $ npm test
      Server
        âœ“ should return homepage HTML
        âœ“ should return 404 for unknown page
    
    2 passing (100ms)
    ```
  - **Troubleshooting:**
    - If tests fail, read the error messages for clues.
    - Ensure the server is not already running on the test port.
    - Check for typos or logic errors in your code or tests.

- `npm run build` â€” Outputs a message (no build step needed).
  - **What it does:**
    - Runs the `build` script in `package.json` (currently just prints a message).
    - No actual build process is required for static sites.
  - **When to use:**
    - Not required for this project, but included for convention or future use.
  - **Example output:**
    ```sh
    $ npm run build
    No build step needed for static site.
    ```

### Docker
- `docker build -t nodejs-app:latest .` â€” Builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
- `docker run -p 3002:3002 nodejs-app:latest` â€” Runs the container and maps port 3002 on your machine to port 3002 in the container.

### Kubernetes
- `kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml` â€” Deploys the app pod.
- `kubectl apply -f k8s-service.yaml` â€” Exposes the app via NodePort.
- `kubectl get pods` â€” Lists running pods.
- `kubectl get services` â€” Lists services and their ports.
- `kubectl logs <pod-name>` â€” Shows logs for troubleshooting.
- `kubectl port-forward service/nodejs-app-service 30080:3002` â€” Forwards local port 30080 to service port 3002 (useful if NodePort is not working).

### CI/CD
- The GitHub Actions workflow automates all the above steps on every push or pull request.

## 11. Troubleshooting & Best Practices

- **App not accessible:**
  - Check pod and service status: `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get services`
  - Check logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
  - Ensure ports match in `index.js`, Dockerfile, and Kubernetes YAMLs.
  - Try port-forwarding if NodePort is not working.
- **Docker build issues:**
  - Ensure all files are copied in the Dockerfile.
  - Check for missing dependencies in `package.json`.
- **CI/CD failures:**
  - Check GitHub Actions logs for errors in build, test, or deploy steps.
- **Security:**
  - Never commit secrets or passwords to your repository.
  - Use environment variables and GitHub secrets for sensitive data.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Add more routes in `index.js` for dynamic content.
  - Add more tests in `test/` for better coverage.

---

## 12. Customization

- Edit `public/index.html` and files in `public/assets/` to change your website content and style.
